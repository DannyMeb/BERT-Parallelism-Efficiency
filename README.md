# BERT-Parallel-Architecture-Efficiency

This repository is dedicated to the exploration of fine-tuning the BERT Base Uncased model using different parallel training architectures. It focuses on the comparison between traditional data parallelism implemented with PyTorch and a more advanced data-pipeline parallelism strategy facilitated by DeepSpeed.

## Project Overview

- **Model**: BERT Base Uncased, a transformer-based model optimized for a variety of English text.
- **Dataset**: SQuAD v2, a challenging benchmark dataset for question-answering models.
- **Objective**: To assess the training efficiency and effectiveness of different parallel training architectures on a single-node machine equipped with NVIDIA A-100 GPUs.
- **Experiments**:
  - **Baseline**: Na√Øve Data Parallelism with PyTorch.
  - **Experiment-1**: Data-Pipeline Parallelism with 2 GPUs using DeepSpeed.
  - **Experiment-2**: Data-Pipeline Parallelism with 4 GPUs using DeepSpeed.
